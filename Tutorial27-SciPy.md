## Introduction to SciPy

- SciPy is an open-source Python library that is used for scientific and technical computing. 
- It is built on top of the NumPy library, and 
- it provides a large number of functions for optimization, integration, interpolation, signal processing, linear algebra, and more.
-  It is one of the most popular libraries for scientific computing in Python.

## Install SciPy using pip
To install, run the following command in the terminal:
```python
pip install scipy  
```

## Creating a function in SciPy

Creating a function in SciPy is similar to creating a function in Python. 
You can use the def keyword to define a function, and you can use the functions provided by SciPy to perform scientific calculations.

For example, let's create a function that computes the square root of a number using the scipy module:

```python

import scipy

def sqrt(x):
    return scipy.sqrt(x)
```

## Modules of SciPy
SciPy provides a large number of modules for different scientific calculations. Here are some of the most commonly used modules:

### 1. scipy.optimize
The scipy.optimize module provides functions for optimization, which is the process of finding the best solution to a problem. 
It includes functions for minimizing or maximizing functions, finding roots of equations, and more.

### 2. scipy.integrate
The scipy.integrate module provides functions for numerical integration, which is the process of finding the area under a curve. 
It includes functions for computing definite integrals, solving ordinary differential equations, and more.

### 3. scipy.interpolate
The scipy.interpolate module provides functions for interpolation, which is the process of estimating the value of a function for an intermediate point. 
It includes functions for cubic splines, B-splines, and more.

### 4. scipy.signal
The scipy.signal module provides functions for signal processing, which is the process of analyzing and manipulating signals. 
It includes functions for filtering, Fourier transforms, wavelet transforms, and more.

### 5. scipy.linalg
The scipy.linalg module provides functions for linear algebra, which is the study of linear equations and their solutions.
It includes functions for solving linear systems, computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and more.

### 6. scipy.stats
The scipy.stats module provides functions for statistical analysis, which is the process of analyzing data to draw conclusions. 
It includes functions for computing probability distributions, performing hypothesis tests, and more.

These are just a few of the modules provided by SciPy. There are many more modules available for scientific computing in Python, and 
SciPy is a great library to use if you need to perform complex scientific calculations.

## SciPy provides a large number of functions for scientific and technical computing.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the most commonly used functions:

- Integration functions: **_quad, dblquad, tplquad, fixed_quad, quadrature, romberg-**

- Optimization functions: **_minimize, root, linprog, curve_fit, fmin, fmin_bfgs, fmin_powell, fmin_cg, fmin_ncg_**

- Interpolation functions: **_interp1d, interp2d, interpn, griddata, spline, BSpline_**

- Linear algebra functions: **_solve, inv, det, eig, eigvals, svd, cholesky, qr, lu, norm_**

- Fourier transform functions: **_fft, ifft, fft2, ifft2, fftn, ifftn, rfft, irfft, dct, idct_**

- Distance functions: **_euclidean, cityblock, hamming, jaccard, pdist, cdist_**


## SciPy constants
There are a variety of constants that are included in the scipy.constant sub-package.These constants are used in the general scientific area. 
Let us see how these constant variables are imported and used.
```python

#Import golden constant from the scipy   
import scipy
from scipy.constants import pi
print("sciPy - pi = %.16f"%scipy.constants.pi)
print("sciPy -golden ratio  Value = %.18f"%scipy.constants.golden)
Output: 
sciPy - pi = 3.1415926535897931
sciPy -golden ratio  Value = 1.618033988749894903 
```
As you can see, we imported and printed the golden ratio constant using SciPy.
The scipy.constant also provides the find() function, which returns a list of physical_constant keys containing a given string.

Consider the following example:

```python
from scipy.constants import find  
find('boltzmann')
 Output:
['Boltzmann constant',
 'Boltzmann constant in Hz/K',
 'Boltzmann constant in eV/K',
 'Boltzmann constant in inverse meter per kelvin',
 'Stefan-Boltzmann constant']
 ```
Here is how you can get the value of the required constant:

 The scipy.constant provides the following list of mathematical constants.
